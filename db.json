This included their class (like Crew, 1st, or 2nd), gender (Male or Female), and other details.\n\nNext, I organized this information to count how many males and females belong to each class. This counting helps us understand the distribution of genders within each class.\n\nThen, I decided to use a bar chart to display this information clearly. In the chart, each class is represented on the horizontal axis, while the vertical axis shows the number of individuals. I used different colors to distinguish between males and females, making it easy to see the differences at a glance.\n\nFinally, I added labels and a title to the chart to ensure that anyone looking at it could easily understand what it represents. After creating the chart, I saved it as an image file so it could be shared or viewed later.",

I also added labels to the chart to clarify what it represents, including a title and labels for the axes.
